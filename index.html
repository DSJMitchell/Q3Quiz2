<h1>Encanto (2021)</h1>
<p>Directed by: Jared Bush, and Byron Howard</p>

<b><p>SYNOPSIS</p></b>
<P>The Madrigals are an extraordinary family who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia in a charmed place called the Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift -- every child except Mirabel. However, she soon may be the Madrigals last hope when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is now in danger.</P>

<b><p>PERSONAL REVIEW</p></b>
<p>"This movie illustrates the pressure of having a magical and special family. Mirabel, who is the only one different from the rest of her family, was seen through by her family. No matter how hard she tried to save her family, Abuela still thinks that she is doing something wrong. I understand Abuela's pov, since she lost her home once, but she was being way to pretective that she is hurting her family. This movie shows the pressure of culture and traditions."</p>

	<h1>Turning red (2022)</h1>
<p>Directed by: Domee Shi</p>

<b><p>SYNOPSIS</p></b>
<P>A thirteen-year-old girl is torn between staying her mother's dutiful daughter and the changes of adolescence. And as if the challenges were not enough, whenever she gets overly excited she transforms into a giant red panda.</P>

<b><p>PERSONAL REVIEW</p></b>
<p>"This is actually a unique way to show puberty and adolesence in a fantasy disney film, and the concept of the Chinese culture is well done. However, the movie is a bit rushed and it kind of defeats logic and the independent thinking of the characters. I mean, come on, a giant red panda comes to school and the first instict is to take pictures? If you're in a boy band and a giant red and angry panda appears out of nowhere and the first instinct is to sing a song to it? I liked the movie, but it was a bit rushed and it makes no sense."</p>

	<h1>Elemental (2023)</h1>
<p>Directed by: Peter Sohn</p>

<b><p>SYNOPSIS</p></b>
<P>In a city where fire, water, land, and air residents live together, a fiery young woman and a go-with-the-flow guy discover something elemental: how much they actually have in common.</P>

<b><p>PERSONAL REVIEW</p></b>
<p>"THIS IS ACTUALLY SO CUTE!! The love is story is just beautiful and the societal problems this movie represents is just so beautiful as well. This shows racism/descrimination, and a forbidden love that blooms between Ember and Wade. I'm so happy how this movie ends, and I love their chemistry. "</p>
